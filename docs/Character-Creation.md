# Character Creation

## Introduction

To start creating your character, simply type the create_character command. The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts to define your character's core attributes:

- Name: Give your character a name that reflects their personality and backstory.
- Race: Choose from a variety of races, each with its own unique abilities and traits. Some popular options include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings.
- Class: Select a class to determine your character's role in the party. Whether you prefer the martial prowess of a Fighter or the arcane magic of a Wizard, there's a class for everyone.
- Alignment: Choose an alignment to define your character's moral and ethical stance. Common alignments include Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil, and Neutral Good.
- Background: Select a background to provide your character with a rich history and skills. Backgrounds can range from a simple Soldier to a complex Noble.

Once you've completed these steps, the CLI will generate a detailed character sheet. However, it does not include your character's ability scores, skills, and proficiencies. Or the feats, spells, and Equipment due to limited knowledge of D&D, but the future will include the Equipment and spells. However, you would be unable to add ability scores, skills, and proficiencies, so you would have to do it online with D&D beyond or by paper and dice.
